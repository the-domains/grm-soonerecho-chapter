Sooner ECHO (Education in Consumer Health Options) to support those who have attended the A Wellness Journey class hosted by

a Licensed Certified Facilitator of Angie's Option Inc. and the GrassRoots Movement or GRM. This is also designed to create community and support from each other and those who know of the work we do in educating folks in the three areas: Altered Food and how that is impacting our health, What is natural about synthetic supplementation, and Glycosylation or how your immune system functions and cells talk to each other. We will direct folks to safe and trusted companies who work in harmony with the environment and offer non GMO, chemical free, real food. When we identify local businesses who match the belief and mission of the GRM, we will direct folks to those as well.
