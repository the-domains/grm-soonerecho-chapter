description: 'A study reported in the online Journal of Biological Chemistry, 2011 (1), documents a remarkable finding from scientists at the University of Califonia at Irvine (UCI). In 2011, Dr. Demetriou and colleagues discovered that environmental and inherited risk factors associated with MS, which were poorly understood and not known to be connected, converge to affect how specific sugars are added to proteins regulating the disease.'
