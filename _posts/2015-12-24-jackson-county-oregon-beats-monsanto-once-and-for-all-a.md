title: "Jackson County, Oregon, Beats Monsanto - Once and For All: A lawsuit launched by GMO farmers, in an attempt to overturn the GMO crop cultivation ban passed in May of 2014, has been settled. Under the settlement, the Jackson County ban passed by voters will stand, and the federal court ruling upholding the measure and supporting farmers' right to grow without GMO contamination will not be appealed. Hats off to a GMO Free Jackson County!! On to the next county! READ: http://www.ourfamilyfarmscoalition.org/ Sonoma County, California has just launched a citizen ballot initiative to ban GMO crop cultivation. If you live in Sonoma County, please volunteer to help put this initiative on the ballot for November 2016. If you don't live in the county, you can help by donating and spreading the word.
